File list:
1. Image Classification Using Logistic Regression
> Image Classification on the MNIST ASL Dataset using simple Logistic Regression. Accuracy: ~50%
1. Image Classification Using Transfer Learning
> Image Classification trained using ASL Alphabet Dataset and tested on the ASL Alphabet Test Dataset. Accuracy: ~76%

All the datasets I used are available on kaggle. I wrote about these image classifications on Medium. Access my blogs [here](www.medium.com/@gryangalario).
